## Introduction

"Push It Forward" is a community-driven initiative that aims to make weekends a little brighter by challenging individuals to create small web applications focused on spreading positivity. You can solo it, code jam it, it doesn't matter!

We believe that technology can be a force for good, and we want to harness that power by inviting you to join us in this friendly challenge. Each weekend, we encourage participants to take a break from the routine and invest their time in crafting web applications that bring smiles, laughter, or inspiration to others.

Whether it's a game that brings a moment of joy, an interactive experience that encourages mindfulness, or a platform that shares uplifting messages, every project has the potential to make a difference. The goal is not just to code but to create moments that resonate with people, reminding them of the beauty and positivity in the world.

So, if you're passionate about making a positive impact and have an itch for coding, join us in the "Push It Forward" challenge! Together, let's create and spread happiness one web application at a time

## Guidelines

- Projects should be short and sweet, so try to keep this limited to a weekend if you can (no points deducted if it takes longer)
- Optionally, you can fork this project so we can track Push It Forward projects ([What is a fork?](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo))
- Get people involved even if you don't think your idea is that great! Share your idea and it can transform into something even better. You can even create a fork to this idea and make it better :-)
- There are a lot of ways to contribute to Push It Forward projects, such as contributing code, ideas, or even suggestions to existing ideas. There is a place for everyone to do their part
- Your project should be inclusive and promote unity and harmony. Any project that is made in the spirit of being offensive will be given the No-No Chair (and banished from our project)

## Quick Start

- Fork this project and clone your repository
- Update the README.md file to introduce and explain your idea
- Commit it and push it (forward) to your forked repository (I was waiting the whole time to use this pun)
- Build it!

If you want to build something but don't have an idea, check out the forked projects to see what you can build! If you have an idea but don't know where to start, write about it in the README.md and someone can fork your project and build it. Or you can even join every project and submit suggestions for improvements!
